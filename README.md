# Cinemahole
In the Great Era Entertainment,Cinema play a important role in our life.Cinema is important because it's the only art form that allows you to truly experience life through/in another person's eyes/head. We can create reality's that are otherwise inaccessible or impossible to grasp alone in our own heads.Movies affect many of us powerfully because the combined impact of images, music, dialogue, lighting, sound and special effects can elicit deep feelings and help us reflect on our lives. They can help us to better understand our own lives, the lives of those around us and even how our society and culture operate.
Beyond just entertaining us, in uncertain times great movies remind us of fundamental values that sometimes get lost in the commotion but that time and again have seen us through. Qualities that sound almost quaint when you name them, like integrity, courage and compassion.
And for this come forth my project CinemaHole.We know that everyone have their own  distinct flavour for movies.And for that I Created this project. It recommand person a movie acording to thier flavour. 
Its a WebApp, completely build on Django Framework and a ML model I've trained. What it does is that it shows you accurate recommendation on movies base of your profile.
